# Chapter 17: The Epic Conclusion 

Welcome back, demigods! In this chapter, we will be discussing the epic conclusion to the Percy Jackson series, including all of the amazing books that follow the original five. What began as a simple quest for a stolen lightning bolt in The Lightning Thief quickly grew into a full-fledged battle against the Titans and the ultimate showdown of heroes vs. villains that we all know and love. 

But we don't need to tell you that. You're already well aware of the incredible journey that Percy Jackson and his friends have gone through. From battling the forces of the Underworld in The Sea of Monsters, to racing against time to save Artemis in The Titan's Curse, to descending into the maze of the Labyrinth in search of Daedalus in The Battle of the Labyrinth, and finally, to the ultimate confrontation with the Titan Lord Kronos in The Last Olympian. 

But the story didn't end there. Percy Jackson's tale continued through a whole new set of adventures and challenges in books like The Lost Hero, The Son of Neptune, and The Mark of Athena, as he sets out to save his new home at Camp Half-Blood and the entire world from the forces of chaos and destruction. 

Throughout it all, Percy demonstrated leadership, bravery, and compassion as he grew from a scared, uncertain boy to a confident and powerful demigod. He proved that anyone, no matter how unlikely, can be a hero if they have the courage to stand up for what's right. 

And of course, we can't forget about the incredible graphic novels, Greek mythology guides, and other spin-off books that continue to expand the world of Percy Jackson, like Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Ultimate Guide, Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes, and Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief: The Graphic Novel. 

To help us wrap things up, we have a special guest joining us today: none other than the author himself, Rick Riordan! Rick, thanks for joining us. Can you tell us a little about your experience writing the Percy Jackson series and how it feels to see it come to an end? 

Rick: "Thanks for having me! It's been an incredible journey writing these books and seeing how much they've meant to readers all around the world. When I first started writing The Lightning Thief, I had no idea it would turn into such a huge phenomenon. But it's been an honor to see how much these characters and their stories have resonated with so many people. It's bittersweet to see the series come to an end, but I'm proud of what we've accomplished and excited to see what the future holds for Percy and his friends!" 

Well said, Rick. We couldn't agree more. And while the series may be over, the adventures of Percy Jackson and his friends will always live on in our hearts and imaginations. Until next time, demigods!
