# Chapter 14: Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief: The Graphic Novel

Welcome back, demigods! In the previous chapter, we explored the incredible stories of brave Greek heroes as told by Percy Jackson. Now, it's time to dive into an exciting graphic novel adaptation of the very first book in the Percy Jackson series: The Lightning Thief.

The Lightning Thief: The Graphic Novel is a collaboration between author Rick Riordan and illustrator Robert Venditti. Together, they bring to life the thrilling story of Percy Jackson, a demigod who discovers his true identity as the son of Poseidon and sets off on a quest to retrieve Zeus' stolen lightning bolt.

Throughout this chapter, we'll not only explore the exciting events in the story, but also learn how to use coding to help Percy on his journey. You'll learn how to create interactive maps to plan out Percy's journey, how to code spells and potions to aid our heroes, and so much more.

So grab your copy of The Lightning Thief: The Graphic Novel and let's jump into the world of Percy Jackson once again!
# 14.1 Interactive Map of Percy's Journey

One of the most exciting parts of The Lightning Thief is following Percy and his friends as they journey across the United States in search of clues to Zeus' lightning bolt. To help us keep track of their journey, let's create an interactive map using Python.

First, we'll need to import the folium library, which allows us to create interactive maps. We'll also need to set the starting latitude and longitude for our map, which we can choose based on the starting location of our heroes.

```python
import folium

# Starting coordinates for New York City
start_lat = 40.7128
start_long = -74.0060

# Create map centered on starting location
map = folium.Map(location=[start_lat, start_long], zoom_start=6)
```

Now that we have our map set up, we can add markers for each location that Percy and his friends visit. Here's an example of adding a marker for their first stop: Camp Half-Blood.

```python
# Coordinates for Camp Half-Blood
chb_lat = 40.6542
chb_long = -73.7921

# Add marker for Camp Half-Blood
folium.Marker([chb_lat, chb_long], popup='Camp Half-Blood').add_to(map)
```

By adding markers for each location Percy and his friends visit, we can create an interactive map that allows us to follow their journey every step of the way.

# 14.2 Coding Spells and Potions

Throughout Percy's journey, he encounters many strange and magical creatures. To help him get past these obstacles, he needs to use spells and potions.

Let's create a simple spell using Python. The spell will be called "Water Whip" and will create a whip made of water that Percy can use to fight off monsters.

```python
def water_whip():
  # Code to create water whip spell
  print("You have created a whip made of water!")
```

And of course, to help Percy on his journey, he'll need some potions. Here's an example of a healing potion that he can use to restore his health:

```python
def healing_potion():
  # Code to create healing potion
  print("You have created a healing potion! Drink it to restore your health.")
```

By creating spells and potions using Python, we can help Percy on his journey and defeat monsters along the way.

# 14.3 Greek Mythology Quiz

Let's test our knowledge of Greek mythology with a fun quiz! Here are a few sample questions:

1. Who is the god of thunder?
   A. Apollo 
   B. Zeus 
   C. Poseidon 
   D. Hades 

2. Which monster has snakes for hair?
   A. Medusa 
   B. Chimera 
   C. Minotaur 
   D. Harpy 

3. Who is the god of the sea?
   A. Hades 
   B. Apollo 
   C. Poseidon 
   D. Athena 

Answers: 
1. B. Zeus 
2. A. Medusa 
3. C. Poseidon 

By testing our knowledge of Greek mythology, we can better appreciate the incredible world that Rick Riordan has created in the Percy Jackson books.
In this chapter, we explored a few different ways to use code to help Percy Jackson on his journey in The Lightning Thief: The Graphic Novel.

First, we used the folium library in Python to create an interactive map of Percy's journey across the United States. We started by importing the folium library and setting the starting latitude and longitude for our map:

```python
import folium

# Starting coordinates for New York City
start_lat = 40.7128
start_long = -74.0060

# Create map centered on starting location
map = folium.Map(location=[start_lat, start_long], zoom_start=6)
```

Then, we added markers for each location that Percy and his friends visited, like Camp Half-Blood:

```python
# Coordinates for Camp Half-Blood
chb_lat = 40.6542
chb_long = -73.7921

# Add marker for Camp Half-Blood
folium.Marker([chb_lat, chb_long], popup='Camp Half-Blood').add_to(map)
```

By adding markers for each location, we could create an interactive map that allows us to follow Percy's journey every step of the way.

Next, we created some simple spells and potions using Python. For example, we created a "Water Whip" spell that Percy could use to fight off monsters:

```python
def water_whip():
  # Code to create water whip spell
  print("You have created a whip made of water!")
```

And we also created a healing potion that he could use to restore his health:

```python
def healing_potion():
  # Code to create healing potion
  print("You have created a healing potion! Drink it to restore your health.")
```

By creating spells and potions using Python, we can help Percy on his journey and defeat monsters along the way.

Finally, we tested our knowledge of Greek mythology with a fun quiz! We included questions like, "Who is the god of thunder?" and "Which monster has snakes for hair?" to help us better appreciate the incredible world that Rick Riordan has created in the Percy Jackson books.

Overall, by incorporating code into our exploration of The Lightning Thief: The Graphic Novel, we can add an extra layer of interactivity and engagement to the story. We hope this chapter has inspired you to explore the possibilities of coding in your own adventures!
