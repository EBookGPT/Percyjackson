# Chapter 16: Percy Jackson and the Singer of Apollo

Welcome back, demigods! In our last chapter, we explored the adventures of Percy and his fellow demigods as they fought monsters, solved riddles, and uncovered secrets in "The Demigod Files". Now, get ready to dive into another thrilling adventure in "Percy Jackson and the Singer of Apollo"!

This time Percy's adventure includes a special guest, the one and only Lin-Manuel Miranda. The best-selling author of "Hamilton: An American Musical" and "In the Heights" brings his talents to the world of Percy Jackson, creating a story filled with music, humor, and action.

In this chapter, we follow Percy as he teams up with the god Apollo (who is unfortunately human at the moment) to save the Oracle of Delphi from a dangerous band of monsters. Along the way, they encounter the infamous King Midas, who has a unique power that may just turn the tide of the battle in their favor.

As with all of Percy's adventures, there will be plenty of challenges and obstacles for him to overcome. But with his loyal friends by his side, and the help of a certain musical deity, Percy is sure to come out on top.

So, grab your sword, put on your magical cap, and get ready to venture into the world of "Percy Jackson and the Singer of Apollo"!
## The Challenge: Save the Oracle of Delphi

Percy and Apollo must work together to save the Oracle of Delphi from a band of fearsome monsters. These monsters, known as the Eidolons, have taken over the Oracle's temple and are wreaking havoc on the ancient site.

To make matters worse, the Oracle's powers are fading fast. If she is not rescued soon, she will lose her connection to the spirit world and the very fabric of reality will be at risk.

Percy and Apollo must navigate the treacherous labyrinth of the temple and battle the Eidolons to reach the Oracle and save her from certain doom. But with each passing moment, the Oracles' powers weaken, making the journey even more perilous.

## The Solution: Work Together and Use Music

To overcome this daunting challenge, Percy and Apollo must work together and use all of their unique abilities. Apollo's musical prowess will come in handy, as the Eidolons are vulnerable to the power of song.

With the help of Apollo's lyre, Percy and his friends will create music to weaken and defeat the Eidolons. In addition, Percy's experience battling monsters will be invaluable as they navigate the dangerous temple.

Through their teamwork and determination, Percy and Apollo will be able to save the Oracle of Delphi and restore balance to the world.

## The Code: Using Music as a Weapon

To defeat the Eidolons, Percy and Apollo use the power of music. Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical talent is showcased in this chapter, with his original composition "Eidolon's Lament" playing a crucial role in the story.

Here is an example of how they used Python code to create the musical spell that weakened the Eidolons:

```
import time

def play_song(song):
    for note in song:
        # play the note
        play(note)
        # wait for the note to finish
        time.sleep(note.duration)

def weaken_eidolons():
    # load the song
    song = load_song("Eidolon's Lament")
    # play the song
    play_song(song)
    # the Eidolons are weakened!
```

By playing the notes of the song using this Python code, the Eidolons are weakened and become easier to defeat.

## Fun Fact: Lin-Manuel Miranda's Inspiration

Lin-Manuel Miranda found inspiration for "Eidolon's Lament" in the ancient Greek musical tradition of the aulos. The aulos was a double-reed instrument that was often used in religious rituals and was believed to have the power to communicate with the spirit world. By incorporating elements of ancient Greek music into his composition, Miranda adds an authentic touch to Percy's adventure.
In the chapter "Percy Jackson and the Singer of Apollo", Percy and Apollo used music as a powerful weapon to weaken the Eidolons and save the Oracle of Delphi. The code used to create the musical spell in the story was in Python and helped to demonstrate the concept of using code to make music.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

```
import time

def play_song(song):
    for note in song:
        # play the note
        play(note)
        # wait for the note to finish
        time.sleep(note.duration)

def weaken_eidolons():
    # load the song
    song = load_song("Eidolon's Lament")
    # play the song
    play_song(song)
    # the Eidolons are weakened!
```

The first step of the code is to import the necessary libraries, which in this case is just the "time" library.

```
import time
```

Next, the code defines a function called "play_song", which takes a "song" object as an argument. The song object is a list of notes that make up the song.

```
def play_song(song):
```

The function loops through the notes of the song using a "for" loop. For each note, the function calls a "play" function to play the note, and then uses the "time.sleep" function to wait for the note to finish playing.

```
for note in song:
    # play the note
    play(note)
    # wait for the note to finish
    time.sleep(note.duration)
```

The "weaken_eidolons" function loads the "Eidolon's Lament" song using a "load_song" function - this function would have been defined somewhere else in the code.

```
def weaken_eidolons():
    # load the song
    song = load_song("Eidolon's Lament")
```

The "play_song" function is then called using the song object that was just loaded. This plays the song, which weakens the Eidolons.

```
    # play the song
    play_song(song)
    # the Eidolons are weakened!
```

Overall, this code demonstrates how music can be used as a powerful tool in storytelling and how code can be used to create music.
